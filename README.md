"A web application on REST APIs for OSDHACK'22 .We often go on Instagram and check stories of our friends, mates, Colleagues, and mostly of our Idols whom we follow & most of the time the stories are interesting ,fascinating and we just wanna have it in our local storagea or share it with others on WhatsApp but unfortunately we can't or we have to ask the other person to send us. So I come up with a solution and created this web app "InstaStory" that allows you to download those stories without knocking on someone else's DM ."
